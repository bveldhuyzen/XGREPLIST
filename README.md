# XGREPLIST
XGREPLIST is a non-invasive non-surveiling XKEYSCORE simulator that runs in chatGPT (and probably others) by prompting the AI to alter behaviour and become a search and analytical tool in the form of a terminal. 

When the AI catches up, XGREPLIST will dig into the digital world with great determination. Additional modules to further increase search and analytical skills are in testing phase. Stats/algorithm/visualization options to be included after initial testing. Free to use and edit by all.

Pending:
- search tools (testing/online)
- Wolfram Alpha integration (testing)
- WHOIS lookup (testing/online)
- Scientific/medical calculator integration
- Web archive lookup / log to archive (testing/online)
- BASH functionality
- Statistical analysis
- Sentiment analysis (testing/online)
- Perspective analysis (testing/online)
- Output visualization 
- Search result validation (lie detector)
- Data upload / outbound messenger (testing/offline)
- MDR compliance scanner
...

For prototype use/testing, enable web browsing on the AI, and copy-paste the prompt from XGREPLIST_prototype (or *_2).

EDIT: If AI cannot keep up with XGREPLIST_prototype (may have browsing / click issues), use XGREPLIST_prototype_2.

EDIT_2: -ninja edit- testing again
