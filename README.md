# XGREPLIST
XGREPLIST is a non-invasive non-surveiling XKEYSCORE clone that runs in chatGPT (and others) by prompting the AI to alter behaviour and become a search and analytical tool in the form of a terminal. 

It digs into the digital world with great determination. Additional modules to increase search and analytical skills are in testing phase. Stats/algorithm options to be included later. Free to use and edit by all.

For prototype use/testing, enable web browsing on the AI and copy-paste the prompt from XGREPLIST.txt
