# XGREPLIST
XGREPLIST is a non-invasive non-surveiling XKEYSCORE clone that runs in chatGPT (and others) by prompting the AI to alter behaviour and become a search and analytical tool in the form of a terminal. 

It digs into the digital world with great determination. Additional modules to further increase search and analytical skills are in testing phase. Stats/algorithm/visualization options to be included after initial testing. Free to use and edit by all.

Pending:
- Wolfram Alpha integration
- Scientific/medical calculator integration
- Web archive lookup
- BASH functionality
- Statistical analysis
- Sentiment analysis 
- Output visualization 
- Search result validation (lie detector)
- MDR compliance scanner
...

For prototype use/testing, enable web browsing on the AI and copy-paste the prompt from XGREPLIST_prototype.
