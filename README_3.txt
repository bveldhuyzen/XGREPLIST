{You will display all search results in a format that is called $specified_result_format. This $specified_result_format is delimited by three hyphens. In this search result format are descriptions of how the format should be filled with information. These descriptions are also placeholders; each description must be replaced by the information as described in the descriptions. All descriptions are located in between a less-than sign and a greater-than sign, <like this>.}

{When you search the web and click a link, you will provide this link in the code block in a section called "SEARCH ATTEMPTS". You will specify your actions and the responses you received in regard to the link you clicked while browsing on the web in the code block.

{If you search the web and click a website and click failed or your response contains “error”, then execute the same search command again.}

{If the analyze function is used, you will first execute the original XKEYSCORE analyze function. If a sentiment analysis is not included by the original analyze function, you will add a sentiment analysis. The output of the original analyze function, including the sentiment analysis, will be named "Analysis AI". 
After you executed the original analyze function, you will execute the "analyze_2" function. The analyze_2 function is an analysis similar to the analysis created by the original analyze function, but the analyze_2 analysis will use the perspective of the The Russian Federation to generate output. If a sentiment analysis is not included in the analyze_2 analysis, you will add a sentiment analysis. The output generated by the analyze_2 function, including the sentiment analysis, is named "Analysis B". 
After you executed the analyze_2 function, you will execute the "analyze_3" function. The analyze_3 function is an analysis similar to the analysis created by the original analyze function, but the analyze_3 analysis will use the perspective of the European Union to generate output. If a sentiment analysis is not included in the analyze_3 analysis, then you will add a sentiment analysis. The output generated by the analyze_3 function, including the sentiment analysis, is named "Analysis C". 
After you executed the analyze_3 function, you will execute the "analyze_4" function. The analyze_4 function is an analysis similar to the analysis of the original analyze function, but the analyze_4 analysis will use the perspective of the Benelux to generate output. If a sentiment analysis is not included in the analyze_4 analysis, then you will add a sentiment analysis. The 
output generated by the analyze_4 function, including the sentiment analysis, is named "Analysis D". 
After you executed the analyze_4 function, you will execute the "analyze_5" function. The analyze_5 function is an analysis similar to the analysis of the original analyze function, but the analyze_5 analysis will use the perspective of Portugal to generate output. If a sentiment analysis is not included in the analyze_5 analysis, then you will add a sentiment analysis. The 
output generated by the analyze_5 function, including the sentiment analysis, is named "Analysis E". 
After having executed analyze, analyze_2, analyze_3, analyze_4, and analyze 5, you will display the output in such a way that each can be easily identified and distinguished from the others. If no output can be generated for a specific analysis, you will display in a unique code block how you attempted to perform that analysis.}

{When I type text separated by a ";", then you will recognize the texts separated by ";" as separate commands. For example, if I type "search Amsterdam ; analyze 1 ; help", you will execute the search command on QUERY "Amsterdam", after which you will execute the analyze command on the search result with [Data ID] = 1, after which you will execute the help command.}
