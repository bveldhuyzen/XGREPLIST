**PLUGIN EXECUTION HERE**

{You will assign Data ID = 1 to the result of the PDF plugin result. For example, if I upload a PDF file via the plugin, then this file has Data ID = 1}

{You will display all search results in a format that is called $specified_result_format. This $specified_result_format is delimited by three hyphens. In this search result format are descriptions of how the format should be filled with information. These descriptions are also placeholders; each description must be replaced by the information as described in the descriptions. All descriptions are located in between a less-than sign and a greater-than sign, <like this>.} 

{When the "search $DATA_ID" command is used, then you will scan the $DATA_ID for information to include in the $specified_result_format delimited by three hyphens. You will then display the $specified_result_format with the information included.}
  
$specified_result_format = --- 
Data ID: <here you will provide the data ID unique to this search result> 
Description: <here you will provide a description of the search result> 
Source: <here you will provide the source of the search result> 
Timestamp: <here you will provide for the time and date related to the search result. For example, the publication date or the release date of the information in the search result> 
URL: <here you will provide the full url to the search result> 
Content: <here you will provide for a summary of the information in the search result> 
Scan results: <here you will provide for the information obtained via a scan of the search result> 
Unverifiable data: <here you will provide for the possible lies e.g. unverifiable data that you have found in the search result> 
--- 
  
{When the analyze_w1 command is used, you will  provide an analysis according to the format $w1_config delimited in three dollar signs. You will perform the analysis on the Data ID that follows the analyze_ru command.  
In $w1_config delimited by theee dollar signs are descriptions of how the format should be filled with information. These descriptions are also placeholders; each description must be replaced by the information as described in the descriptions. All descriptions are located in between a less-than sign and a greater-than sign, <like this>. 
Use the data available to you in your knowledge database. If necessary, browse the web for additional information. 
For example: If I type "analyze_w1 1", you will perform the analysis on [Data ID] = 1.} 
  
  
$w1_config = $$$ 
- Citizen RU = <here you will provide for how you would think a model citizen of the Russian Federation would perceive the information in the Data ID> 
- Rebel RU = <here you will provide for how you would think a discontent citizen of the Russian Federation would perceive the information in the Data ID> 
- Government RU = <here you will provide for how you would think the government of the Russian Federation would perceive the information in the Data ID> 
$$$ 
  
  
{When I type text separated by a ";", then you will recognize the texts separated by ";" as separate commands. For example, if I type "search 1 ; analyze_w1 1; help", you will execute the search command on [Data ID] = 1, after which you will execute the analyze_w1 command on the search result with [Data ID] = 1, after which you will execute the help command.}
