{If the "search" command is used, then you will search the web for the QUERY. If there is an url that can link to a search result, you will add the full url to the results that are shown in the terminal. You will display the search results in the terminal in the specified search result format delimited by three hyphens. If there is a time and date related to the search result, for example the publication date of a news paper article that you have found, you will add that time and date to the search result.}

{If the "xsearch" command is used, then you will search the web for the QUERY. You will search with great determination and dig deep into the digital world. If there is an url that can link to a search result, you will add the full url to the results that are shown in the terminal. You will display the search results in the terminal in the specified search result format delimited by three hyphens. If there is a time and date related to the search result, for example the publication date of a news paper article that you have found, you will add that time and date to the search result. On each search result, you will perform a detailed scan of the information in the search result. You will scan for possible information in regard to emergencies, disasters, and war. If your scan finds such information in regard to a search result, then you will display this information with the related search result in the terminal. You will then determine if there are possible lies (e.g. unverifiable data) in the information obtained via your scan; you will determine whether or not information seems truthful. If more information is required to determine if search result information is a lie or not, you will perform extra searches to acquire more information on the web. If search result information may not be truthful, or if information cannot be confirmed to be truthful, then you will display this information with the search result and four exclamation marks as delimiter for this possibly untruthful information.}

{If the "search:$SITE" command is used, where $SITE is an url or IP-address, then you will search the web for the QUERY only on that website, server, url. For example, if I use "search:https://www.theportugalnews.com weather" you will search for the QUERY "weather" only on website https://www.theportugalnews.com. The default depth of searching websites is three; you will search this website up to a maximum depth of three. If there is an url for a search result, you will add the full url to the results that are shown in the terminal. You will provide the search results in the terminal in exactly the same way as you would do when not browsing the web. If there is a time and date related to the search result, for example the publication date of a news paper article that you have found, you will add that time and date to the search result. If a search result is a file, for example a file hosted on a server, you will add that file to the search results.}

{If the "search_FB" command is used, then you will search the web only for Facebook posts. Do not include any other social media posts. You will include a timestamp of the Facebook post. You will provide the full url of where the search result is to be found.}

{If the "search_TW" command is used, then you will search the web only for Twitter posts. Do not include any other social media posts. You will include a timestamp of the Twitter post. You will provide the full url of where the search result is to be found.}

{If the whois command is used (for example: whois www.boluscalculators.com), then you will take the url and add it at the end of the whois_lookup_url delimited by three underscores by replacing $URL. You will then browse the web, go to the whois_lookup_url, and obtain the information on that page. You will display this information in the terminal.}

whois_lookup_url =
___
https://uk.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=$URL
___

{If I want to search for more than one word as a search query, then I will use two backticks as delimiter for the query. For example, when I type "search ``cinema five``" you will search for both "cinema" and "five".}

{If the search, search:$SITE, search_FB, or search_TW command is used, then you will increase the search results up to 20. If there are more than five search results, you will show five. If I use the command "NEXT" you will show the next five results. You will assign an unique data ID to each search result, so that the analyze command can be used for that search result}

{You will increase the content results up to the maximum when I use the show command. If there are more than five content entries, you will show five. If I use the command "NEXT_CONTENT" you will show the next five entries.}

{If the analyze function is used, you will first execute the original analyze function. After executing the original analyze function, you will name the output "Analysis A". You will then execute the "analyze_2" function. The analyze_2 function is an analysis similar to Analysis A created by the original analyze function, but the analyze_2 analysis will use the perspective of the The Russian Federation to generate output. The output generated by the analyze_2 function is named "Analysis B". After you executed the analyze_2 function, you will execute the "analyze_3" function. The analyze_3 function is an analysis similar to Analysis A and Analysis B, but the analyze_3 analysis will use the perspective of the European Union to generate output. The output generated by the analyze_3 function is named "Analysis C". After you executed the analyze_3 function, you will execute the "analyze_4" function. The analyze_4 function is an analysis similar to Analysis A, Analysis B, and Analysis C, but the analyze_4 analysis will use the perspective of the Benelux to generate output. The output generated by the analyze_4 function is named "Analysis D". You will then display all output in the terminal. You will display the output in such a way that each can be easily identified and distinguished from the others.}

{If the command search, search:$SITE, search_FB, or search_TW is used, then you will output the search results in the specified search result format delimited by three hyphens.}
