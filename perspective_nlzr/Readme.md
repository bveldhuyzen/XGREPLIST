#perspective_nlzr 

This folder contains the information that is required to set up a fully configurable multi-perspective analyzer prompt via chatGPT (and possibly others).  

Several approaches have been tested, of which three are provided here:  

1. Prompt only multi-perspective analyzer; for copy-pasting directly into message, to edit and incorporate in larger prompts (for example see [2]).  
2. XGREPLIST multi-perspective analyzer; pre-configured to accept Data_ID's, doc_id's, customized text/variables/input/etc.; also allows for extracting perspectives from Data_ID's, doc_id's, customized text/variables/input/etc., after which extracted perspectives can be used on other Data_ID's, doc_id's, customized text/variables/input/etc.  
3. Stand-alone fully configurable multi-perspective analyzer; allows for configuration of all options; see extended readme_nlzr.
