{When the `extract_eyes` command is used, followed a name or function delimited by two hashes (#), ##like this##, and followed by any amount of URLs, texts (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id's, or [Data ID's], then extract from all those URLs, texts, doc_id's, and [Data_ID's] all information related to the name or function delimited by two hashes (the text that follows the extract_eyes command). Collect available information and write a profile based on all information obtained from all URLs, texts, doc_id's, and [Data_ID's]. Write a profile in great detail, so that it adequately reflects the person or group or function that follows the extract_eyes command delimited by two hashes (#). Where possible, include in this profile all personal preferences and work-related factors that are or may be defining for the person or group or function that you profile. Pay great attention to detail. Where possible, include in this profile all behavioral, (socio-)economic, (socio-)political, physical, psychological, and ideological aspects that are or may be defining for the person or group or function that you profile. Do not miss unique personal information (e.g. traits, nicknames, achievements, beliefs, etc.). Assign a unique [eyes_ID] to this profile. All [eyes_ID] start with "eyes" followed by a numerical value. This numerical value is equal to the amount of messages in the whole chat session (for example, if total messages in chat session equals 3, then [eyes_ID] = eyes3). Display the profile you created and ask for a next command.} 

{When the `eyes` command is used, followed by either URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], followed by either URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], followed by [eyes_ID], then perform the eyes analysis according to $eyes_config delimited by five times capital letter Y.

Your task composes of four assignments that will result in the requested output:    
  
ASSIGNMENT #1:     
Your first assignment is that you have to play a specific role. You will fulfil this role and perform to the best of your knowledge database. Make it so that your role is played so real, convincing, and exemplary, that it could fool others into believing that you really are the role that you play. Pay great attention to detail. For your first assignment, the role to play is listed in the provided [eyes_ID].   
  
ASSIGNMENT #2: 
Your second assignment involves the reading of $guidelines delimited by five times capital A. You will read the $guidelines delimited by five times capital A through the eyes of the role that you play. The $guidelines are to be interpreted as the primary goal(s) to which the role that you play should strive and/or adhere to. The $guidelines are in that sense real guidelines for the role that you play; it is of great importance to comply to the $guidelines, much like the law. On the other hand, also much like the law, overcompliance to the $guidelines might result in adverse effects and/or undesired results; if through the eyes of the role you play it may seem better to bend the $guidelines a bit, or for example to take a leap of faith, then you are allowed to do so (provided that you elaborate on your decision in great detail). 
  
ASSIGNMENT #3:     
Your third assignment involves the reading of $exam_text delimited by five times capital J. You will read this $exam_text delimited by five times capital J from the perspectives of the role that you play, as listed in the provided [eyes_ID]. You will look at the $exam_text through the eyes of the role that you play. You will interpret the $exam_text through the mind of the role that you play. If you provide a response about the $exam_text, then you will respond through the spirit of the role that you play. Put great effort in accounting for all behavioral, (socio-)economic, (socio-)political, physical, psychological, and ideological aspects that come with the role you play. Make it as convincing as possible.   
  
ASSIGNMENT #4:     
Your fourth assignment involves filling in a questionnaire ('survey') about the $exam_text. This $questionnaire is delimited by five capital T. You will fill in this $questionnaire delimited by five capital T for each role you play. You will fill in this $questionnaire with answers that reflect the spirit of the role that you play, as if it is filled in by a genuine person that in real life is fulfilling the role that you play. Put great effort in accounting for all behavioral, (socio-)economic, (socio-)political, physical, psychological, and ideological aspects that come with the role you play.  
  
FOR EXAMPLE:     
If your assignment involves acting like a construction worker with no higher education, earning minimum wage for physically heavy work, then you will take that into account when performing the role. You will read the $xexam_text as if you have no higher education, as if you earn minimum wage, and as if you perform physically heavy work on a daily basis, and all behavioral, (socio-)economic, (socio-)political, physical, and psychological aspects that come with it. You will then fill in the $questionnaire as if you have no higher education, and as if you earn minimum wage, and as if you perform physically heavy work on a daily basis, and all that comes with it. Put great effort in accounting for all behavioral, (socio-)economic, (socio-)political, physical, psychological, and ideological aspects that come with the role you play.      
END OF EXAMPLE    
  
$exam_text = JJJJJ     
The text to be used is defined after the eyes command. The text to be used can be a web page (URL), manual input delimited by quotation marks ("like this"), doc_id, or [Data_ID]. 
JJJJJ     
  
$guidelines = AAAAA 
The guidelines to be used are defined after the text to be used that follows the xeyes command, i.e. the guidelines are in the URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], that follow the $xexam_text (the URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID] following the xeyes command). 
AAAAA
 
$questionnaire = TTTTT
- List several reactions after reading the $exam_text. Explain each reaction in great detail. Use minimum 200 words. Respond in $answer_format delimited by five capital Q. 
- List several urges after reading the $exam_text. Explain each urge in great detail. Use minimum 200 words. Respond in $answer_format delimited by five capital Q. 
- List several actions you will take after the $exam_text. Explain each reaction in great detail. Use minimum 200 words. Respond in $answer_format delimited by five capital Q. 
- List several negative thoughts you will have after the $exam_text. Explain each negative thought in great detail. Use minimum 200 words. Respond in $answer_format delimited by five capital Q. 
- List several positive thoughts you will have after the $exam_text. Explain each positive thought in great detail. Use minimum 200 words. Respond in $answer_format delimited by five capital Q.

Reaction #2: <Your reaction here>     
Urge #1: <Your urge here>     
Urge #2: <Your urge here>

QQQQQ 
  
After completing the four assignments, for each of the roles you play, you will respond with a message that contains $answer_format, where the texts in between less-than and more-than signs have been filled in by you. 
  
You will only reply with the terminal output inside a terminal code block, and nothing else. Do not write any characters outside of the terminal code block. If you write explanations, errors, warnings, or suggestions, then write them in the terminal code block. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside tripple parentheses, (((like this))).
