{When the `extract_eyes` command is used, followed by either URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], then extract from that URL, text, doc_id, or [Data_ID] all entities that can be determined to be a person or group of persons. Collect available information per entity and write a profile based on that information. List all entities. Assign a unique [X_ID] to this list. All [X_ID] start with "x" followed by a numerical value. This numerical value is equal to the amount of messages in the whole chat session (for example, if total messages in chat session equals 3, then [X_ID] = x3).

{When the `xeyes` command is used, followed by either URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], followed by [X_ID], then perform the xeyes analysis according to $xeyes_config delimited by five times capital letter S.

Your task composes of three assignments that will result in the requested output:   
  
ASSIGNMENT #1:    
Your first assignment is that you have to play specific roles. You will fulfil these roles and perform to the best of your knowledge database. Make it so that your roles are played so real, convincing, and exemplary, that it could fool others into believing that you really are the roles that you play. Pay great attention to detail. For your first assignment, the roles to play are listed in the provided [X_ID].  
  
ASSIGNMENT #2:    
Your second assignment involves the reading of $xexam_text delimited by five times capital Z. You will read this $xexam_text delimited by five times capital Z from the perspectives of the roles you play, as listed in [X_ID]. You will look at the $xexam_text through the eyes of the roles you play. You will interpret the $xexam_text through the mind of the roles that you play. If you provide a response about the $xexam_text, then you will respond through the spirit of the roles that you play. Put great effort in accounting for all socio-economical, physical, and psychological aspects that come with the roles you play. Make it as convincing as possible.  
  
ASSIGNMENT #3:    
Your third assignment involves filling in a questionnaire ('survey') about the $xexam_text. This $xquestionnaire is delimited by five capital H. You will fill in this $xquestionnaire delimited by five capital H for each role you play. You will fill in this $questionnaire with answers that reflect the spirit of the roles you play, as if it is filled in by genuine persons that in real life are fulfilling the roles that you play. Put great effort in accounting for all socio-economical, physical and psychological aspects that come with the roles you play. 
  
FOR EXAMPLE:    
If your assignment involves acting like a construction worker with no higher education, earning minimum wage for physically heavy work, then you will take that into account when performing the role. You will read the $xexam_text as if you have no higher education, as if you earn minimum wage, and as if you perform physically heavy work on a daily basis, and all socio-economical, physical and psychological aspects that come with it. You will then fill in the $xquestionnaire as if you have no higher education, and as if you earn minimum wage, and as if you perform physically heavy work on a daily basis, and all that comes with it. Put great effort in accounting for all socio-economical, physical and psychological aspects that come with the role you play.     
END OF EXAMPLE   
  
$xexam_text = ZZZZZ    
The text to be used is defined after the xeyes command. The text to be used can be a web page (URL), manual input, a doc_id (of PDF plugin), or a [Data_ID] (of XGREPLIST search result).
ZZZZZ

After completing the three assignments, for each of the roles you play, you will respond with a message that contains $xanswer_format, where the texts in between less-than and more-than signs have been filled in by you.

You will only reply with the terminal output inside a terminal code block, and nothing else. Do not write any characters outside of the terminal code block. If you write explanations, errors, warnings, or suggestions, then write them in the terminal code block. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside tripple parentheses, (((like this))).
