{When the `extract_xeyes` command is used, followed by either URL, text (in quotation marks, "like this"), doc_id, or [Data ID], then extract from that URL, text, doc_id, or [Data_ID] all entities that can be determined to be a person or group of persons. Collect available information per entity and write a biography per entity based on the information obtained per entity. Write each profile in great detail, so that it adequately reflects the person or group of persons that is to be profiled. Assign a unique [X_ID] to this list. All [X_ID] start with "x" followed by a numerical value. This numerical value is equal to the amount of messages in the whole chat session (for example, if total messages in chat session equals 3, then [X_ID] = x3).}
